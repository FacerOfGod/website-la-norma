    Located in the heart of the French Alps, at an altitude of 1,350 meters, La Norma is a charming ski and mountain resort in the Maurienne Valley, Savoie. Designed with families in mind, La Norma is the perfect place to enjoy nature, fun, and quality time—whether you visit in winter or summer.


    ❄️ **Winter Magic:** In the winter months, La Norma transforms into a snowy wonderland. The resort boasts 65 kilometers of ski slopes, suitable for beginners, intermediates, and even thrill-seekers. The ski area is connected with Valfréjus via a ski pass extension, offering even more terrain to explore. From ski schools 🎿 for little ones to freeride zones for teens and relaxing snowshoe hikes for parents, there's something for everyone. Off the slopes, families can enjoy sledding hills, ice skating, and lively après-ski events designed for all ages. And with NormaKids—our childcare and activity service—parents can enjoy a few hours of skiing or relaxation while their children are well taken care of and entertained with fun, age-appropriate activities. 👶🧸


    ☀️ **Summer Adventures:** When the snow melts, the mountains bloom into an outdoor paradise. La Norma becomes a fantastic base for hiking, mountain biking, nature discovery trails, and outdoor games. 🌳🚴‍♀️ Children can explore themed trails, play in the forest playgrounds, or take part in organized activities with our animation team, while parents enjoy panoramic hikes, picnics by alpine lakes, or a bit of well-earned rest on the sunny terraces. 🏕️🌞


    Every week in summer features a new schedule of free family-friendly entertainment, from live music to nature workshops and treasure hunts. La Norma proves that the mountains aren’t just for winter—they're a four-season destination. 🌼🎉

    La Norma is a charming ski and mountain resort in the Maurienne Valley, Savoie.
    Designed with families in mind, La Norma is the perfect place to enjoy nature,
    fun, and quality time—whether you visit in winter or summer.\n\n❄️ **Winter Magic:**
    In the winter months, La Norma transforms into a snowy wonderland. The resort
    boasts 65 kilometers of ski slopes, suitable for beginners, intermediates, and
    even thrill-seekers. The ski area is connected with Valfréjus via a ski pass extension,
    offering even more terrain to explore. From ski schools \U0001F3BF for little
    ones to freeride zones for teens and relaxing snowshoe hikes for parents, there's
    something for everyone. Off the slopes, families can enjoy sledding hills, ice
    skating, and lively après-ski events designed for all ages. And with NormaKids—our
    childcare and activity service—parents can enjoy a few hours of skiing or relaxation
    while their children are well taken care of and entertained with fun, age-appropriate
    activities. \U0001F476\U0001F9F8\n\n☀️ **Summer Adventures:** When the snow melts,
    the mountains bloom into an outdoor paradise. La Norma becomes a fantastic base
    for hiking, mountain biking, nature discovery trails, and outdoor games. \U0001F333\U0001F6B4‍♀️
    Children can explore themed trails, play in the forest playgrounds, or take part
    in organized activities with our animation team, while parents enjoy panoramic
    hikes, picnics by alpine lakes, or a bit of well-earned rest on the sunny terraces.
    \U0001F3D5️\U0001F31E\n\nEvery week in summer features a new schedule of free
    family-friendly entertainment, from live music to nature workshops and treasure
    hunts. La Norma proves that the mountains aren’t just for winter—they're a four-season
    destination. \U0001F33C\U0001F389"
